= Clowder Debug Pod

This has common debugging tools for SREs to help with clowder apps.

Included is a debug script that will spin up a pod with a mounted ACG_CONFIG.
You can then easily run `app-common-bash` in the pod to load the config into environment variables.
Alternatively you can run `jq` commands against `$ACG_CONFIG` to extract config data.
